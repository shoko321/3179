            The World Happiness Report assesses global happiness levels by considering factors like economic prosperity, 
            social support, health, freedom of choice, trust, and generosity. A higher ranking in the report indicates greater 
            overall happiness in a country. This report goes beyond material wealth, emphasizing the importance of mental well-being, 
            social connections, and community resilience.
